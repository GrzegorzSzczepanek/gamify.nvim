## 🐍 Mini-Games

### Vim Snake
Feeling stuck? Type `:GamifySnake` and use `h`, `j`, `k`, `l` to control the snake. Each 🍎 you eat gives you **10 XP**!

### Saper (Minesweeper)
Classic Minesweeper directly in your editor. Type `:GamifySaper`.
- **Controls**: `h, j, k, l` to move, `<Enter>` to reveal, `f` to flag.
- **Reward**: Win the game to earn **200 XP**!

### Sudoku
Classic Sudoku with difficulty levels. Type `:GamifySudoku`.
- **Controls**: `h, j, k, l` to move, `1-9` to enter numbers, `d` to change difficulty, `0/x` to clear.
- **Reward**: Solve the puzzle to earn up to **500 XP**!

### Gomoku (5-in-a-row)
Tic-tac-toe's big sibling: a **20×20** board where you win by lining up **five** stones
in a row — horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Play side-by-side on one machine,
or against a friend over your local network.

<!-- TODO: screenshot of :Gomoku -->
<!-- ![Gomoku](docs/screenshots/gomoku.png) -->

#### Controls
| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `h` `j` `k` `l` | Move the cursor around the board |
| `<Enter>` / `<Space>` | Place a stone on the current cell |
| `r` | Rematch / clear the board (local mode only) |
| `q` / `<Esc>` | Quit back to the dashboard |

`X` always moves first. Win a game to earn **150 XP**.

#### Local mode (one machine, two players)
Just run:
```vim
:Gomoku
```
Two players share the keyboard and take turns placing `X` and `O`. Open it from the
dashboard too: press `t` in `:Gamify`.

#### LAN mode (two machines on the same network)
Play over TCP — no servers, accounts, or extra dependencies. One player **hosts**, the
other **joins**.

1. **Host** (this player is `X` and moves first):
   ```vim
   :Gomoku host 5050
   ```
   Neovim starts listening on port `5050` and waits for an opponent.

2. Find the host's **LAN IP address** (e.g. `192.168.1.42`):
   - Linux/macOS: `ip addr` or `ifconfig` (look for a `192.168.x.x` / `10.x.x.x` address).
   - macOS: System Settings → Network, or `ipconfig getifaddr en0`.

3. **Join** from the second machine (this player is `O`):
   ```vim
   :Gomoku join 192.168.1.42 5050
   ```

Once connected, both boards open and moves sync automatically — you can only place a
stone on your turn. The port is `5050` by default but you can pass any free port, as
long as host and join use the same one.

> **Note:** A rematch (`r`) currently only works in local mode. Over LAN, restart the
> game to play again. You may also need to allow the chosen port through both machines'
> firewalls.

## 🏆 Gamify Katas
Improve your Lua and algorithmic skills without leaving Neovim.
1. Open the menu via `:Gamify` and press `c` (or run `:GamifyChallenges`).
2. Select a challenge (e.g., *Reverse String*, *FizzBuzz*, *Fibonacci*).
3. Write your solution and press `<Enter>` to run tests.
4. Pass all tests to claim your reward!

There are **8 katas**, each solvable once for XP. One is the **⭐ Kata of the Day**
and awards **+50% XP** the first time you solve it each day. Solutions run in a
sandbox, so `solution` won't leak into your global environment.

---

## 🎯 Daily Quests & Combos

- **Daily Quests** — Every day you get 3 randomized objectives (write N lines,
  make N commits, fix bugs, solve a kata, play a game…). Progress is tracked
  live on the dashboard, and clearing all three grants a bonus.
- **Focus Combo** — Keep coding without long breaks to build a focus streak.
  Your XP multiplier rises the longer you stay in flow (up to x3), and resets
  after you go idle.
- **Prestige** — Once you reach the level cap (default 50), run `:GamifyPrestige`
  to reset your XP in exchange for a permanent XP bonus that stacks each rank.

## 📊 Statusline

Show your level, an XP bar, and your streak in your statusline:

```lua
-- lualine example
require('lualine').setup {
  sections = {
    lualine_x = {
      function() return require('gamify.logic').get_statusline_bar() end,
    },
  },
}
```

`get_statusline_bar(bar_width)` renders e.g. `Lvl 12 [████░░] 🔥7`.
For a minimal variant use `get_statusline_text()` → `Lvl 12 🔥 7`.

---

## 🛠️ Configuration

Pass a table to `setup()` to override any default. Shown below with defaults:

```lua
require('gamify').setup {
  xp = {
    per_lines = 10,        -- 1 XP per N lines written
    per_keypresses = 50,   -- 1 XP per N keypresses
    per_error_fixed = 5,   -- XP per resolved diagnostic error
    clean_code = 15,       -- XP for saving a buffer with zero errors
    new_day = 10,          -- XP for the first launch on a new day
    random_luck = 50,      -- XP for the rare lucky bonus
    snake_per_apple = 10,
    saper_win = 200,
  },
  clean_code_once_per_buffer = true, -- prevent `:w` XP farming
  random_luck_chance = 40,           -- 1-in-N chance per save / new day
  focus = {
    enabled = true,
    idle_timeout_sec = 120,  -- a longer gap resets the combo
    tier_seconds = 300,      -- every N focused seconds bumps the multiplier
    max_multiplier = 3.0,
  },
  quests = {
    enabled = true,
    count = 3,               -- quests generated per day
    completion_bonus = 200,  -- bonus XP for clearing all daily quests
  },
  leveling = { A = 0.001, B = 1.02 }, -- level = floor(1 + A * (xp ^ B))
  prestige = {
    enabled = true,
    level_required = 50,
    xp_bonus_per_rank = 0.05, -- +5% XP per prestige rank
  },
  ui = {
    confetti = true,
    popups = true,
    xp_popups = true,
    popup_timeout_ms = 5000,
  },
}
```
